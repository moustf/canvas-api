# canvas-api
A simple projectiles game using html5 canvas and JavaScript.

## Live link:
Check it out form [HERE](https://moustf.github.io/canvas-api/).

## User journey: 
- When the user first opens the game, he/she will find the the player -missiles thrower- at the center of the canvas element, and the projectiles will move form every side of the canvas to the center of the canvas.
- To make the projectile disappear, move the cursor to its direction and click to send a missile to deal with it XD.
- When the a missile reaches a projectile, they both will disappear.

## User stories: 
- As a user, I should be able to see the missiles thrower at the center of the canvas.
- As a user, I should be able to see the projectile come form the canvas edges to the center.
- As a user, I should be able to throw missiles to target the projectiles.
- As a user, I should be able to see the missiles and the projectile disappear when two of them come across each other.
